# Details::   Specific loader to support Excel files.
#             Note this only requires JRuby, Excel not required, nor Win OLE.
#
#             Maps column headings to operations on the model.
#             Iterates over all the rows using mapped operations to assign row data to a database object,
#             i.e pulls data from each column and sends to object.
